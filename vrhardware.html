            <p>The brain is the core processor of a human being. The most direct way for hardware to interact with a person is by linking directly to the brain, such as through Neuralink. However, to accurately connect to the brain currently requires implanting a chip inside the brain and performing craniotomy, which is not practical for most situations. Perhaps one day in the future, it will be possible to achieve something like the way humans connect to the virtual world in <em>The Matrix</em>.</p>

            <p>Humans primarily have five senses: vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. Smell and taste involve the perception of chemicals, which makes them difficult to dynamically generate through hardware and therefore less common. Vision is based on electromagnetic waves, hearing on vibrations, and touch on pressure and temperature—all of which are relatively easy to dynamically generate.</p>

            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>The primary device for vision is the display. The performance of different displays varies based on factors such as:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Resolution</li>
                <li>Field of View (FOV)</li>
                <li>Refresh Rate</li>
                <li>Pixel Density</li>
                <li>Color Accuracy</li>
                <li>Contrast</li>
                <li>Brightness</li>
                <li>Distortion</li>
                <li>Glare</li>
            </ul>

            <p>One of the most important factors is pixels per degree (PPD), calculated as pixels divided by the total field of view. For example, the Apple Vision Pro has a horizontal pixel resolution of 3680 and a field of view (FOV) of 120°, giving a PPD of approximately 30. Higher PPD improves visual quality, with 60 PPD being the upper limit of human perception.</p>

            <h2>Hearing</h2>
            <p>Modern speaker technology can realistically simulate various sounds, including distance, size, and frequency, to the point of being indistinguishable from reality. There are no significant technical barriers in the hardware for sound reproduction.</p>

            <h2>Touch</h2>
            <p>Touch sensitivity varies across the body, with the hands being the most sensitive. Haptic feedback is commonly delivered through controllers. More advanced solutions, such as haptic gloves and suits, are under research but remain costly and cumbersome.</p>

            <h2>Output Methods</h2>
            <p>Humans primarily output information through sound and movement:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sound Recognition:</strong> Advances in AI have dramatically improved speech recognition accuracy since 2022.</li>
                <li><strong>Motion Recognition:</strong> While controllers remain the most precise method, research is ongoing into neural wristbands and EEG monitors for more intuitive control.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Chips and Batteries</h2>
            <p>Most VR devices rely on SoC (system-on-chip) technology for compactness and energy efficiency. Battery life remains a limiting factor, with standalone headsets typically lasting 2-3 hours.</p>

            <h2>Sensors</h2>
            <p>Key VR sensors include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Eye Tracking:</strong> Infrared and high-speed cameras track eye movement to determine the user's focal point.</li>
                <li><strong>Motion Tracking:</strong> A combination of compass, accelerometer, and gyroscope detects user movements in real-time.</li>
            </ul>
